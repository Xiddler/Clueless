# clueless-webapp

I got the clueless webapp working on donaghmccarthy.ie today. Yipee.
I pushed the working repo from the remote server to github.com.
Then I cloned it to my laptop. I then cleaned up the folders. The main/ original is in /home/donagh/../sd64/1donaghs_stuff/Projects/Clueless.

I think I might add a timer / stopwatch in the webapp version...

This is the web version of my Clueless word game.
The webapp is based on my earlier lanner project which was a pastebin for the LAN - where I can copy paste to my laptop from phone over WiFi.
